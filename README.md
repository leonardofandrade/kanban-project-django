# Kanban Project

## Project Overview
The Kanban Project is a web application built using Django, aimed at helping users manage their tasks visually. The project implements the Kanban methodology, allowing users to create, update, and track tasks through different stages.

## Installation

To get started with the Kanban Project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kanban_project.git
   cd kanban_project
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
   
   We recommend using a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can create one using:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   If you have a `requirements.txt` file, you can install the necessary packages with:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If `requirements.txt` is not provided, ensure that Django is installed:
   
   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```

4. **Run initial migrations:**

   After installing dependencies, you'll need to set up the database:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create a superuser (optional):**

   Run the following command to create an admin user:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Start the development server:**

   Finally, you can start the server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   You will be able to access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Usage

Once the server is running, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your web browser. You can add, update, or delete tasks. To access the admin panel, go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin` and log in with the superuser credentials you created.
